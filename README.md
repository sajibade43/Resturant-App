# Summarized Plan and Approach
Server Details and Project Setup
Firstly, it's important for me to understand how to work with the server, connect the server and API together before starting the build face.

A server will be used that will run on my own computer. As in a traditional restaurant menu or when anyone enters a restaurant. Items are sorted into categories and have a title, description, price. In this app there will be an opportunity to modify the options, descriptions, and images that are returned from the API.

In this project, the menu list comes from an API. By storing the list on a server, the restaurant can update the menu without requiring customers to update the app they're using. As long as the features of the app don't change, the content that the app displays can be adjusted to reflect the restaurant's latest offerings

The app will utilize interactions such as. buttons, user inputs, scroll view.
